Rough modification notes for BM used by K5JB.  This BM is usable on MS-DOS,
Unix, Coherent, and OS9/68K.

See send.c and unix.c for temporary fixes for Coherent related to missing
function tmpfile().  Need to return and make provisions to remove temporary
files when bm exits.
Never did return and make the above fixes.
Incorporated changes to increase number of characters the word wrap looks back
to find a space at end of line, and loosened test for correct date format
in incoming mail.  Some systems don't strictly comply with RFC-822.
Merged my changes with those made by Bob, N0QBJ, to make this code compile
and run under OS9-OSK.  Bumped version up to 3.1.1l (ell)  Joe, K5JB
v.3.1.1.m: Changed presentation of ELM's faulty dates and added capability to 
dig into the From: line for <user@host> field.  Cleaned up compiler warnings.
Functional differences: Disabled SETVBUF in the MS-DOS version, removed some 
things (like direct video option), and non functional signal handling.  Made 
a config.h to better manage things.

Some memory requirements with BM in DESQview:
Using Z, the Aztec editor, 150k DV window, BM with no vbuf, 13k file can be
edited.  With 170k window, 33.5K file can be edited.

Using Qedit, 180K DV window, 29K file can be edited; w/ 170K, 19K; with
160K, 9K file.  In these tests we shut DV window on close.  If we want
to leave it open while testing for error messages, editing file size is
reduced about 3k.

Qedit therefore takes about 14.5K more to work.  I didn't try to find minimum
DV window size that would work with Qedit.

1/29/94 Added quoting of imported messages (~M [<number>])
6/6/94 Fixed error in record file, added -a <aliasfile> and -r (rcfile> to
permit specifying alternate file names with starting command line.  BM
looks for these files in the same directory where it would find the original
defaults.

6/18/94 Added bfgets() to bmutil.c so mail files with ^Z wouldn't get trun-
cated.  Also cleaned up some misuse of feof().

7/13/94 Added switch, OPTALIAS to conditionally add the -a alias arg.
It is not normally desirable because NET and NOS use the hardcoded name,
alias.

8/22/94 Added filter to prevent user @ host errors and cleaned up for COH4
Did some playing with BC.  Redid makefile to handle either. (vers n1)

3/3/95 Corrected "size" which was lopping off trailing characters if there
were some characters pushed back on stream; added skip over leading command
spaces, fixed where screen banner scrolled away if BM started with a long
message list.  made version n2

10/95 Modified the "Hit any key to continue" to permit advancing one line
at a time if the C/R key was used.
