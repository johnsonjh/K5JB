These nine files are the revised TCP/IP user manual originally prepared by 
Bdale Garbee in 1989.  It has been revised to include features that have
been added since, and to include information that was available from TAPR's
Plug'N'Play disk, as well as elsewhere.

These files are unformatted ASCII text.  They can be scanned with any text 
reading utility (such as list), or any word processor capable of importing
text files.  Chapter0 is actually the preface.  It contains some intro-
ductory information and instructions on how to obtain a formatted printable
output using the included utility, pagenet.exe.  I suggest looking over
chapter0 before proceeding.  Note the index which will lead you to the 
chapter(s) you may be interested in seeing first.

Enjoy!  Joe, K5JB, "The Editor"
