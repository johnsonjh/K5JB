This is an example of exlist, one of two files used with Grapes Multi-port
code.  It can't have comments like this in it so if you edit this file,
delete these first six lines.  The other required file is digilist.  Each
line of up to 10 lines has two entries in it: call sign, and port name.  See
Chapter 5 for explanation of Mulport.  Mulport has to be compiled into the
net code.  (Comments after the first two fields are OK)
