# sample startup.net file with some explanation.  See the  user manual
# Chapter 6 for explanation of commands.  (For Unix, startup.net is 
# similar to MS-DOS's autoexec.net except for the attach command and
# commands that deal with 8086 hardware interfaces.)
#
# Note that most of the values in this example file are the same as NET's
# defaults, but are put here for reference, and to indicate best placement
# if they are to be used.  In fact, NET only needs four configuration 
# commands and the six startup commands to become fully functional.
#
# For testing, I have route add and arp add entries in this that depend on
# these people being in my hosts.net file.  Remark out these lines before
# trying this startup.net sample.
#
# NET, beginning with version k34, will run with 10 commands. ax25 mycall,
# ip address, hostname, attach, and 6 start commands.  It is highly desir-
# able that you also include the route add default command after you do the 
# port attachment.
#
#  S T A R T U P . N E T  (A sample startup.net file for Unix)
#
# for primary station
hostname k5jb.okla.ampr
ax25 mycall k5jb-10
# optional, but highly desirable, mail box call
ax25 mboxcall k5jb-9
# optional IP only virtual circuit call
ax25 vcipcall k5jb-8
ip address [44.78.0.2]
#
# this causes anything mis-addressed to go to me so I can handle it:
# (Set automatically with ip address command)
#smtp gate 44.78.0.2
#
# Now do some ax25 commands -- some ax25 values are used by later commands
# These are the defaults
#ax25 digipeat on
#ax25 maxframe 1
#ax25 paclen 256
#ax25 retry 10
#ax25 window 2048
#ax25 t1 10000
# ax25 t1 winds up being 9955 because of some integer arithmetic that is
# done. t2 is default of 990 ms. t3 is default 0. Normally leave t3, the check
# timer at 0.  Following would poll in 5 min intervals:
#ax25 t3 300000
# Default t4, the stale circuit timer, is 900 sec (15 min)
#
# attach commands
#
attach asy 0 /dev/tty13 ax25 ax0 0 256 4800
#
# If you have the KPC-4/KAM, you attach it as follows, (This is Multidrop
# KISS, or MDKISS, that showed up on your startup screen.)  The only
# difference between this and a standard attach asy command is the number
# on the end (2, for example).
#
# Using /dev/tty13, and using two ports, as an example:
#
#attach asy 0 /dev/tty13 ax0 0 256 4800 2
# and make further reference to its two ports as ax00 and ax01 (instead of
# ax0) in the examples that follow.
#
# For a slip link to another computer using /dev/tty14: set up with 9600 baud 
# and fairly high mtu:
#attach asy 0 /dev/tty14 slip sl0 0 4096 9600
#
# At this point you have done all the required configuraion commands for
# NET to work properly if you aren't going to use netrom.  You can now go
# to the start commands below.
#
# Add any param commands that are needed to change kiss timing, e.g.:
#
# slottime
#param ax0 3 1
# txtail
#param ax0 4 2
#
# 'route add' entry for that other computer:
#route add k5jbslip sl0
#
# netrom stuff that doesn't hurt anything (if you aren't using Net/ROM)
# You need both of these two:
attach netrom
netrom interface ax0 #IPJB 170
# If for some reason you don't want to send ANY node broadcasts on ax0, do:
#netrom bcstifle ax0 on
# following depends on whether routing tables are wanted or not
# "none" disables filter and lets tables build.
# "accept" permits tables to build only from listed Net/ROM station.
# I recommend only using the best neighbor Net/ROM here.
# DON'T SEND ROUTING TABLES UNLESS YOU HAVE COORDINATED WITH THE OTHERS!
netrom nodefilter mode accept
netrom nodefilter add wd5hjl-2 ax0
# same as above, but abbreviated:
#n n a wd5hjl-2 ax0
# You need this, otherwise it is 0
netrom obsotimer 3600
# This is default:
#netrom qlimit 2400
# Set netrom time-to-live to something reasonable; this is default:
#netrom ttl 16
#
# If you are actually going to use Netrom transport to other IP hosts,
# add commands like the following:
#
# Note:
# "netrom route adds" are explicit routes and are undesirable.  It is better
# to use net nodefilter and let pgrm build tables.  If destinations are prone
# to go away, this method prevents pounding the n/r network trying to send 
# mail to a station that has disappeared.
# In these examples, none of the netrom route adds are explicit which means 
# I have to wait for receipt of a route broadcast before I can initiate a 
# netrom connection.  Mine will respond correctly, however, if an incoming 
# netrom session is initiated before I hear a route broadcast.  (It will have
# a quality of 10, which is usable.)
#
# Note that there are 2, and optionally 3, entries associated with each 
# netrom entry (Again, I don't recommend using the first line of each of the 
# following sets).
#
##netrom route add #ipfwe wb5fwe-10 ax0 194 wd5hjl-2
route add [44.78.0.8] netrom wb5fwe
arp add wb5fwe netrom wb5fwe-10
#
##netrom route add #IPRZX wb5rzx-10 ax0 194 wd5hjl-2
route add [44.78.0.11] netrom wb5rzx
arp add wb5rzx netrom wb5rzx-10
#
# if we are not using Net/ROM, or we don't want to announce ourselves:
# This is the default
#netrom nodetimer 0
# else, if we are doing netrom:
#netrom nodetimer 1740
#
# If we are using netrom, enable this to launch a node broadcast when we start:
#netrom bcnodes ax0
#
# Here we add the arp add and route add commands for stations that are 
# not using netrom:
#arp add kb0qj ax25 kb0qj-10 kb0qj-5
#arp add wb5fwe ax25 wb5fwe-10 wd5hjl-2 n5ang-2 n5ang-1 (alternative route)
#arp add wb5fwe ax25 wb5fwe-10 wd5hjl-2 wb5fwe-3
# etc.
#
# These guys don't use Net/ROM and they are not direct, so they need arp
# entries with digis.  Use route add commands here also if you have 
# multiple interfaces attached:
#arp add n5loa ax25 n5loa-10 #okc2 okc
#arp add k5jbspook ax25 k5jb-11 #okc2 okc
#arp add wd5g ax25 wd5g #okc2 okc
#
# Here are some that require digipeaters to get to
arp add wb5rrr ax25 wb5rrr #okc2 okc osu
arp add kj5c ax25 kj5c #okc2 okc
#
# When no specific route is given, ax0 is taken.  This is not a required, 
# but a highly desirable entry, used any place after your attach command.
route add default ax0
#
# If your IP address coordinator is on the ball, you can probably route 
# everything that is not explicit with gateway commands to gateway hosts.
# In this example, 44.78.8.xx goes to Tulsa, everything else goes, including
# out of state, to Oklahoma City:
#route add 44.78.8/24 ax0 wa5txx
#route add 44/8 ax0 k5jb
#
# Incidentally, if you are dealing with a NOS operator using virtual 
# circuit and he insists on the BBS quickstart, use the same stunt we use
# to deal with ROSE below, i.e. use vax25 in the arp add, and use our 
# vciponly call sign.  Thus we can ignore the spurious frames from his BBS.
#
# Here we deal with stations reachable only by ROSE network, assuming that
# we have set our ax25 vcipcall, above 
#route add wb5cqu ax00
#arp add wb5cqu vax25 wb5cqu-8 k5jb-6 817104
#
# If we were doing ax25 segmentation with him we might use
# route add wb5cqu * 507
# (507 is an mtu that corresponds to a tcp mss 467 to create two segments
# per IP frame in 256 byte packets.  (Don't exceed that with ROSE 
# circuits.  You will blow them up.)  You would use:
# tcp mss 467
# If we are using ROSE which can be terribly slow, we should also do:
#tcp irtt 60000
#
# add any desired ip commands (this is default):
#ip ttl 16
# add any desired tcp commands:
# these are default tcp mss and tcp window.  If doing ax25 segmentation,
# see wb5cqu example above
#tcp mss 216
#tcp window 2048
# If we aren't using ROSE, see above, we could use the default:
#tcp irtt 10000
# If you have pathological circuits you can change the tcp timer type and
# max backoff value, default is exponential, 30 minutes
#tcp timer linear 10
#
# Add the smtp commands, if other than these defaults.
# Optional smtp timer command follows the start smtp command.
# Default maxclients
#smtp maxclients 10
#
# Some miscellanous commands:
# you can put the log anywhere you want.
log /usr/k5jb/net/netlog
# enable the AX.25 mailbox (default)
#mbox on
#
# If you want to use Grapes Mulport code (default for this is off):
#mulport on
# and prepare exlist and digilist files.
#
# If you want telnet users to have a message of the day, do:
motd Hello, I may not be here but your typing may be saved on the screen.
#
# If you want the Netrom and AX.25 chat users to have a message of the
# day different from the default, do:
axmo I would have answered sooner, but I was asleep!
#
# Finally, and this is important to be near the last, start the servers:
start smtp
# smtp timer will be initialized to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).  If you
# want something different, do it here, e.g. you don't want do do mail, do:
#smtp timer 0
start ftp
start echo
start discard
start telnet
start finger
#
# End of startup.net sample
