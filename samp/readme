You will have to edit these sample files to suit your station.

All of these files but one go in the NETHOME directory (e.g. \usr\net).
If you followed my example, you will have a directory called \usr\public,
where you can permit FTP users to brouse.  In it you will have another 
directory, mbox, (\usr\public\mbox) where you can put files suitable for 
mailbox people to download.  Here is where you put "morehelp" after you edit
it to suit yourself. You probably won't be using "digilist" and "exlist" so 
you can delete them.  (They are only used if your code was compiled with 
Grapes Multi-port function included.  They are included here for 
completeness.)

You will want to write some *.txt files for your \usr\net\finger directory so
users can "put the finger on" you.  Make them plain ASCII files and include
what information you want in them.

Enjoy!  Joe, K5JB
