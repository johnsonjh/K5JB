(In this file you have to reconcile all the people who may connect to you.
There are two ways to make multiple host names for a given IP address, 1. Make
multiple lines per number -- see 44.78.0.8, or 2. put multiple host names on
the line with the IP address -- see 44.78.0.2.  Reason for name variations
is because users sometimes change their host names in BM messages and yours
won't be able to reply.  Delete this paragraph after you have modified this
file to suit.  Note to 44.78 users -- not kept up to date.  FTP all.txt from
me to get the current list.)
