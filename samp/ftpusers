( sample file - this password stuff is academic since it is transmitted 
in the clear, but what the hay!  I encourage unique user names though so 
the log will then reveal who did what.  
  Format is, user_name password home_directory and permission.
  Splat (*) is a wildcard password.  See user manual for details.  Delete
down to here after you fix this file up for your own use.)
