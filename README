There may no longer be any interest in the old NET program for Unix and
MS-DOS, but I am still running it (along with JNOS) and making occasional
changes to it.

This version contains only a couple of minor changes from k36, but is
uploaded because of the poor judgement I used in uploading .lha archives.
I use .lha archives for portability and convenience but overlooked the fact
that most Unix people don't have it.  One change in k37 is addition of a
deadlock breaker in the lapb layer which can happen if the other station
returns RNR and we miss the RR signalling that it is unbusy.  Now we more
closely follow the AX.25 specification by polling.  I bent the rules and
let it poll even if we are running version 1 protocol, but haven't found
any bad side effects from doing it.  BM has a minor modification that
permits displaying one additional line instead of the full screen at the
"Hit any key..." prompt.

The .tar.Z files uploaded with this kit were done with plain, old tar,
and plain old compress.  These should be the lowest commen denominator.

The only changes in k36 from the previous upload, which was an incremental
upload for k35c on Jan 6, 95, were: 1. Some twiddling with telserv,  2.
revision of the way we discard spurious I frames & modification to VCIP_SSID
to retain vax25 in arp add command, and 3. some modifications to packet
driver which would only affect MS-DOS version.  There was a minor fix
made to BM since the last upload.

It is no longer necessary to put call signs in an iponly table to deal
with ROSE switches.  When ax25 mycall is set, and THEN ax25 mboxcall is
set, a flag will be set to cause all I frames containing F0 PID directed
to our ax25 mycall to be ignored.  If this behavior is not desired, set
ax25 mycall again after setting ax25 mboxcall and I frames to mycall
will spawn a mailbox.  The following were notes used when k35 was
posted.

Version k37 was uploaded to ftp.ucsd.edu as a complete source code kit.
Most of the previous files are irrlevant.  A complete kit of useful files
would consist of:

k5jb.k37.txt   -- This file
k5jb.k35upd.usr -- File for users.  Contains most recent changes.
k5jb.k37.tar.Z -- Source code for Unix KA9Q NET
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z -- Relevant user documentation for same.
k5jb.k37bm.tar.Z  -- Source code for BM v.3.3.1n4, mailer.  Updated a little.
k5jb.samp.tar.Z -- Optional, Sample startup files for beginners.

(These files on ftp.ucsd.edu are either in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming,
or in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/k5jb.)

                        Brief description of Unix NET

NET is designed as an MS-DOS application, so does not make full use of Unix's 
multi-tasking ability but runs quite well in Unix.  You can use it in a Unix 
windowing environment (or in shell layers), or you can shell out and leave
NET running in the background.  If you choose to use shell layers you must
prevent blocking on input if you make the window session inactive.  See the
doc on how to do this.

If you are unfamiliar with NET (the TCP/IP suite, written by Phil Karn, KA9Q, 
and preceding his current project, NOS), you need to break out the files in 
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z and browse them.  k5jb.k37.tar.Z contains a file,
unix.note, which has modification information.
