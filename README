Version k35 was uploaded to ftp.ucsd.edu as a complete kit.  Previous files
are irrlevant.  The complete kit consists of:

k5jb.k35.txt   -- This file
k5jb.k35upd.usr -- File for users.  Contains recent changes.
k5jb.k35.tar.Z -- Source code for Unix KA9Q NET
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z -- Complete user documentation for same.
k5jb.k35bm.tar.Z  -- Source code for BM v.3.3.1n, mailer.  Updated a little.
k5jb.samp.tar.Z -- Optional, Sample startup files for beginners.

(These files on ftp.ucsd.edu are either in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming,
or in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/k5jb.)

                        Brief description of Unix NET

NET is designed as an MS-DOS application, so does not make full use of Unix's 
multi-tasking ability but runs quite well in Unix.  You can use it in a Unix 
windowing environment (or in shell layers), or you can shell out and leave
NET running in the background.  If you choose to use shell layers you must
prevent blocking on input if you make the window session inactive.  See the
doc on how to do this.

If you are unfamiliar with NET (the TCP/IP suite, written by Phil Karn, KA9Q, 
and preceding his current project, NOS), you need to break out the files in 
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z and browse them.  k5jb.k35.tar.Z contains a file,
source.note, which has modification information.

                          Brief description of kit

More detail on files contained in this set:

k5jb.k35.tar.Z
Contains files needed to compile NET under various System V, Release 3 
versions of Unix (I use AT&T); under Coherent, and under OS9-68K.  This file
also contains source.note, a collection of revision notes, an os9osk.note,
and unix.note for information specific to Unix, Coherent and OS9-68K that I
not yet included in the main documentation.  (This .txt file is also the
preface to unix.note.)  W5GFE compiled NET and BM under SCO Unix (80386)
Sys V, release 3, both with the native compiler and with GNU.  Others report
compiling it under various versions of Unix, but were not specific on
versions used.

k5jb.k35bm.tar.Z
Contains source for Bdale's Mailer (BM).  Works with same environmental 
variables as K5JB version of NET.  Has been sanitized to prevent memory 
violations.  Version in this kit is 3.3.1n, modified to deal with some
non-RFC-822 compliant mailers (like ELM), and to correct some errors in
file reading.

k5jb.k35upd.usr
Contains changes made to NET.  Written for the user.  Some of the
changes affect composition of startup.net.

k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z
Contains NET and BM user's documentation.  Targeted for MS-DOS users, but 
contains essential Unix information.

k5jb.samp.tar.Z
Contains a rough set of sample configuration files for setup.  I didn't
make any particular effort to cover all instances so you must look at
chapter0 and decide if you want to go on from there.

Coherent users have no need to shell out or use the Ctrl-\ (quit) switch on
NET if they are using virtual terminals.  NET runs fine when its window is
not active.  In fact, using the quit signal removes one of the two places
where the CPU is released to do other tasks.  If you start NET with no
serial ports attached (like if you have no startup.net file), and issue
a quit signal to ignore keyboard input, NET will become a CPU hog,
consuming an enormous amount of the machine's resources.

The Coherent problems described in earlier NET releases are now fixed with
completion of some functions by the time version 4.0.1 was released.  Block-
ing reads with timed releases, finer time granualarity, and normal creation
of temporary files makes this the Coherent version almost the same as the
regular Unix version of NET.
