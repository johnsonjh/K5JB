There may no longer be any interest in the old NET program for Unix and
MS-DOS, but I am still running it (along with JNOS) and making occasional
changes to it.  The k36 set of files will include this file and two LHA
files.  The LHA files are done under Unix, and contain complete source
code kits for NET and BM.  I hope you have lha on your Unix computer.

The only changes from the last upload, which was an incremental upload
for k35c on Jan 6, 95, were: 1. Some twiddling with telserv,  2.
revision of the way we discard spurious I frames & modification to VCIP_SSID
to retain vax25 in arp add command, and 3. some modifications to packet
driver which would only affect MS-DOS version.  There was a minor fix
made to BM since the last upload.

It is no longer necessary to put call signs in an iponly table to deal
with ROSE switches.  When ax25 mycall is set, and THEN ax25 mboxcall is
set, a flag will be set to cause all I frames containing F0 PID directed
to our ax25 mycall to be ignored.  If this behavior is not desired, set
ax25 mycall again after setting ax25 mboxcall and I frames to mycall
will spawn a mailbox.  The following were notes used when k35 was
posted.

Version k35 was uploaded to ftp.ucsd.edu as a complete kit.  Previous files
are irrlevant.  The complete kit consisted of:

k5jb.k35.txt   -- Similar to this file
k5jb.k35upd.usr -- File for users.  Contains recent changes.
k5jb.k35.tar.Z -- Source code for Unix KA9Q NET
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z -- Complete user documentation for same.
k5jb.k35bm.tar.Z  -- Source code for BM v.3.3.1n, mailer.  Updated a little.
k5jb.samp.tar.Z -- Optional, Sample startup files for beginners.

(These files on ftp.ucsd.edu are either in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming,
or in /hamradio/packet/tcpip/k5jb.)

                        Brief description of Unix NET

NET is designed as an MS-DOS application, so does not make full use of Unix's 
multi-tasking ability but runs quite well in Unix.  You can use it in a Unix 
windowing environment (or in shell layers), or you can shell out and leave
NET running in the background.  If you choose to use shell layers you must
prevent blocking on input if you make the window session inactive.  See the
doc on how to do this.

If you are unfamiliar with NET (the TCP/IP suite, written by Phil Karn, KA9Q, 
and preceding his current project, NOS), you need to break out the files in 
k5jb.k35doc.tar.Z and browse them.  k5jb.k35.tar.Z contains a file,
source.note, which has modification information.
